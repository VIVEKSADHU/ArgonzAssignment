## Core Features:

- Settings Interface: Display a settings interface with general and notification tabs.
- Language Selection: Allow users to select their preferred language from a dropdown menu. When a new language is selected, use the browser's translation tool to assist with displaying content in the user's chosen language.
- Timezone Selection: Enable users to choose their timezone from a dropdown menu.
- Time Format Selection: Allow users to select between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats using radio buttons.
- Preference Saving: Implement a 'Save Changes' button to persist user preferences locally using browser storage.
- Context-Aware Help Center: Provide a Help Center link that redirects users to a support page. The link's presence will be based on a tool powered by AI that reasons about the current locale of the app and includes relevant regional policies about data storage, if relevant.
